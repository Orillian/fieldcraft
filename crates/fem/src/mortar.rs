//! Mortar segmentation and integration: the overlap of a secondary (non-mortar) face with a main
//! (mortar) face, and the integration points on it where both faces' shape functions and
//! positions are known.
//!
//! **Segmentation** (M. A. Puso, T. A. Laursen, *A mortar segment-to-segment contact method for
//! large deformation solid mechanics*, CMAME 193:601–629, 2004, §3; A. Popp, M. W. Gee, W. A.
//! Wall, *A finite deformation mortar contact formulation using a primal–dual active set
//! strategy*, IJNME 79:1354–1391, 2009, §3.3). Both faces are projected along the secondary
//! face's unit normal n onto its plane (through its centroid), and the main polygon is clipped by
//! the secondary one (Sutherland–Hodgman; a quadrilateral whose projection is not convex is
//! split into its two triangles first). Each overlap polygon is split into a fan of triangles
//! integrated with the seven-point degree-5 rule (J. Radon 1948; A. H. Stroud, *Approximate
//! Calculation of Multiple Integrals*, Prentice-Hall 1971, T2:5-1), which integrates the products
//! of two shape functions that the tie and the patch test need exactly on triangles and
//! parallelograms (on a general quadrilateral the inverse of its map is not a polynomial, and the
//! rule is accurate to its degree).
//!
//! **Points.** At an integration point y of the plane, each face's coordinates are found by
//! inverting its projected map: the linear one of a triangle, or the bilinear one of a
//! quadrilateral, x(u, v) = a + b u + c v + d u v, whose inverse is the root in [0, 1] of the
//! quadratic (b × d) u² + (b × c − h × d) u − h × c = 0 (h = y − a, × the scalar cross product of
//! the plane). The projection of a bilinear patch onto a plane is the bilinear patch of its
//! projected corners, so the main face's point found this way is the point of the main surface
//! along n through y, warped or not. The [`Sample`] then holds both faces' shape functions, both
//! points in space, the normal and the weight (the plane's area element times the rule's weight).
//!
//! The kernel is written over [`Real`], so the same code gives the values (`f64`), their
//! gradient ([`crate::dual::Dual`]) or their gradient and Hessian ([`crate::dual::Hyper`]) with
//! respect to the corner coordinates, variables `3 i + k` for secondary corner i and
//! `12 + 3 j + k` for main corner j: the exact linearisation of the segmentation, the normal and
//! the projection, which the consistent tangent of mortar contact needs (Popp et al. 2009, §4).
//!
//! **Edges of 2D models** ([`integrate_edges`]): plane strain, plane stress and axisymmetric
//! models touch along element edges, two-node segments in the XY plane. The main edge is
//! projected along the secondary edge's unit normal onto its line, which maps each main point to
//! one parameter of the secondary edge linearly, so the overlap is an interval of that parameter
//! (B. Yang, T. A. Laursen, X. Meng, *Two dimensional mortar contact methods for large
//! deformation frictional sliding*, IJNME 62:1183–1225, 2005, §3). It is integrated with the
//! three-point Gauss–Legendre rule, exact for the degree-3 products Φ_a N_b r that the
//! axisymmetric patch test needs (the edge's out-of-plane measure, the thickness or 2π r at the
//! secondary point, is part of the weight). Points stay three-component with z = 0, so the solver
//! takes edges through the same variables as faces.
